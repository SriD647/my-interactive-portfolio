    description: "Greetings, I'm Sri Rao, a Fullstack Software Engineer hailing from Toronto. My journey in the realm of software engineering has been shaped with the successful completion of a rigorous and comprehensive Full-Stack (MERN) Software Engineering certification course. Beyond technology, I'm an avid fitness enthusiast, continuously striving for progress in my physical well-being. But my pursuits extend further. I'm deeply committed to making a positive impact as a lead volunteer with the Art of Living Foundation. Here I actively support charitable events that uplift underprivileged communities. This fusion of technology, fitness, and humanitarianism drives me forward, propelling me to contribute meaningfully to our ever-evolving world.",
